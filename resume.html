                                Company</a></h3>
                        <p class="date">Feb 2021 - April 2022</p>
                        <p>
                            I actively take a lead on the partner monetization ecosystem ensuring a seamless payouts and
                            earnings experience for our partners.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I took a lead to deprecate the credit wallet system used by our providers and move to a
                            robust
                            commission model. This increased partner payouts experience.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I championed alerting systems for monetization flows to catch leakage of money flowing
                            through
                            the system. I also automated the contribution margin reporting of the entire organization
                            using
                            settlement reports from payment gateways.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I led the design and development of the tipping feature. Users can now tip providers on the
                            platform and
                            setup recurring tips. This has significantly contributed to increase in provider earnings
                            and quality of job received by customers.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In addition, I actively contributed to frontend development in React JS and native Android
                            to deliver
                            features such as Payment with Apps as a payment mode for the team.

                        <p class="date">Feb 2020 - Feb 2021</p>
                        <p>At UC, I worked with the FinTech team to provide seamless payments and payouts experience to
                            our customers and providers. We executed ~400k orders weekly which are served by ~50k
                            professionals generating over 1 M USD in payouts weekly.
                        </p>
                        <p>I redesigned the whole payout process into simple configurable systems which aided business
                            teams to process payouts in a fully automated fashion with 100% accuracy. Integration with
                            banking systems were also executed to automatically validate provider bank accounts using
                            penny testing. The banking integration was also used to automatically transfer payouts to
                            providers bank accounts.</p>
                        <p>I designed and successfully executed the full and final settlement system for providers
                            deboarding.
                            our platform. A new feature Recharge From Payout was introduced which allowed providers
                            to recharge their wallets from their upcoming payouts. </p>
                        <p>
                            I was also heavily involved in infrastructure projects such as the audit logging framework.
                            In addition, I actively participated in the deprecation of a giant monolith with zero
                            downtime.

                        <p>At Gram Vaani, I worked as a computer vision research and development engineer to develop a

                            (<a href="https://tikavaani.org" target="_blank">Tika Vaani</a>)
                            to digitize immunization health records and locate high risk children in remote areas. This
                            was
                            supported by Bill and Melinda Gates foundation and <a href="http://www.birac.nic.in/"
                                target="_blank">BIRAC</a>. I actively
                            collaborated with academics from IIT-D (<a href="https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~chetan/"
                                target="_blank">Dr. Chetan Arora</a>, <a href="https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~aseth/"

                            innovations in the industry domain.</p>
                        <p>I actively scaled the IVRS stack at Gram Vaani to a serverless architecture to handle
                            exponential traffic. I also contributed to the development of new features on the IVRS stack
                            to enhance user interactions. These features range from automated moderation of content,
                            automated quality assurance, topic classification and topic distribution. A shared
                            distributed
                            moderation model with the aid of the community was also added to ensure

                            First, analysed the behaviour of trolls and how
                            human beings interact with them on social media. To this extent, I have analysed the <a

                            Trolling on twitter in the Indian context was also explored. Extensive work has been carried
